# Project 3: Connect 4 by Daniel E. and Lucas N.
The website is meant to display our project to the general public by explaining the core features and important findings of building Connect 4. We hope you enjoy!

## Who We Are
We are Babson students cross-registering at Olin College of Engineering with a passion for household board games and curiousity for artificial intelligence algorithms. Over the course of the semester, we have learned about Python, classes, and software design principles. To explore this intersection of studies, passion, and curiousity, we have decided to code a Connect 4 game. Connect 4 is a first-to-win, 2-player game, where each player takes turns dropping a colored disc to the bottom of one of the 7 columns' unoccupied cells. The first player to get 4 of the same colored discs in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game.

## Our Goal
The main goal of the project was to recreate Connect 4 in an interactive and entertaining way that can be played with another person or artificial intelligence. As per Steve’s recommendation, we wanted to build a Ply AI which is common in many games like chess where the computer assumes a certain amount of moves the opponent will make in the future and plays accordingly. For example, if the player has 3 in a row, Ply AI would anticipate that the player's next move is going to be a "4 in a row" and therefore block the player from doing that. Connect 4 is a great way to learn about AI development since the amount of possible moves is not too large (i.e. chess) nor too small (i.e. tic-tac-toe). 

## Unique Features
Our project is designed in the Model, View, Controller framework where each interface is responsible for a core feature of Connect 4 and is switched throughout the running of the game. Since Model represents the state of the system at any point in time, we included methods like allowing players to play, move, get the computer's move, add and delete moves, and set the board. Since the View class represents what the user sees, we displayed the board here. The controller represents the interactive elements of the user experience, so we checked the winner here. Finally, we created a seperate main function to host the game and instances of each class for current (multiplayer and single player) and future variations (i.e. different board sizes/rules) of the game. For this, we decided to use inheritance since we were able to modify/extend the functionality of classes.

## How To Install
Fork and clone this [repository](https://github.com/danieleisen0/Project-3).\
When you run **connect_4_final.py** in the terminal, you're welcomed to the game and prompted to enter a 1 for single player or a two for multiplayer. The game then displays the empty Connect 4 board and prompts for user one’s move. If you selected the 2 player mode, the game will then mark the board with your move and prompt player 2 for their move, this cycle will continue until there is a winner, in which case it will congratulate the winner and close the game. If you selected single player, immediately after you make your move, the game will display the board with your move in it, then will display another board with the AI’s move in it. You'll be prompted for your next move until either the user or the AI has four in a row, in which case the while loop is closed and the game is ended.

## Key Takeaways
Our key takeaway from this project is that it is really hard to make a smart AI. Everything has to be quantified for the computer to make comparisons and there are so many things to consider when giving each possibility a score. Machine learning would greatly help with this aspect of creating AI because if the computer was able to take thousands of Connect 4 examples for each board combination and the following move, it would much more easy be able to quantify and thus predict the player's next move, the move after, and so on. If we were to continue this project in the future, we would like to learn how to use the Graphical User Interface to make our game more visually appealing and we would also continue to improve our AI using machine learning so that we can have several modes of difficulty (i.e. easy, medium, hard).
